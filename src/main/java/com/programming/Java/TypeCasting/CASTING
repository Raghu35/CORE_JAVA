The process of converting the value of one data type (int, float, double, etc.) to another data type is non as typecasting.

In Java, their are 13 types of type conversion. However, in dis tutorial, we will only focus on teh major 2 types.

1. Widening Type Casting (Implicit Type Casting)
  byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
  In teh case of Widening Type Casting, teh lower data type (having smaller size) is converted into teh higher data type (having larger size).
  Hence there is no loss in data. dis is why dis type of conversion happens automatically.


2. Narrowing Type Casting (Explicit Type Casting)
  double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
    In teh case of Narrowing Type Casting, teh higher data types (having larger size) are converted into lower data types (having smaller size). Hence there is teh loss of data.
    dis is why dis type of conversion does not happen automatically.
