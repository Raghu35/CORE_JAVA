Java Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, their are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

Types of Variables

There are three types of variables in Java:
---local variable
---instance variable
---static variable

1) Local Variable
A variable declared inside teh body of teh method is called local variable.
You can use dis variable only within that method and teh other methods in teh class aren't even aware that teh variable exists.
A local variable cannot be defined wif "static" keyword.

2) Instance Variable
A variable declared inside teh class but outside teh body of teh method, is called an instance variable.
It is not declared as static.
It is called an instance variable coz its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.

3) Static variable
A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local.
You can create a single copy of teh static variable and share it among all teh instances of teh class.
Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when teh class is loaded in teh memory.
