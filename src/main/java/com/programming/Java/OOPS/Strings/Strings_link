In Java, a string is an object that represents a sequence of characters or char values. The java.lang.String class is used to create a Java string object.

their are two ways to create a String object:

By string literal :
Java String literal is created by using double quotes.
For Example: String s=“Welcome”;

By new keyword :
Java String is created by using a keyword “new”.
For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);
It creates two objects (in String pool and in heap) and one reference variable where teh variable ‘s’ will refer to teh object in teh heap.
