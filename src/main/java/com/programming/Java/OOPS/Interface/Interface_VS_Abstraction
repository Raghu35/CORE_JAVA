Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. 
A Java abstract class can have instance methods dat implements a default behavior.

Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. 
An  abstract class may contain non-final variables.


Members of a Java interface are public by default. 
A Java abstract class can has teh usual flavors of class members like private, protected, etc..


Java interface should be implemented using keyword “implements”; 
A Java abstract class should be extended using keyword “extends”.


An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.


A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class.


Interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated; 
A Java abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked if a main() exists.


In comparison with java abstract classes, java interfaces are slow as it requires extra indirection.
